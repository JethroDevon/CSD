an explanation on classes functionality and basic functions within them


• GUI

 will need to contain a lot of swing components for managing options
 for the whole app however the code simulates communication between three
 agents, each agent will have identical functionality therefore will be
 objects  from the Agent class (alice bob and charlie), Agent will extend
 JPanel and therefore will make up part of the GUI.

 - send() and JButton 'send' this will take text from JTextField 'plaintext'
   	  and begin the first step of the selected crypto system, from here
	  on next step will demonstrate each step and sending another
	  plaintext message at any stage will reset the demo.

 - nextStep() and JButton 'next_step' will use static class 'protocol'
          to demonstrate and run each step through the selected
	  cryptosystems protocol, it will also tell the Agent class
	  objects what to do.

 - varios radio buttons, several option buttons will be available these
   	  will have an affect on how the protocol class tells other classes
	  how to encrypt and decrypt things, maybe only should work
	  after a reset else there will be too many unpredictable states 

• Agent

 class will have functions to send text to and recieve from other agents
 ie sendTo( Agent _agent) this is to simulate communication between Alice and
 Bob.
 will contain objects from class encryption in order to have the
 functionality to encrypt and decrypt plaintext as well as a few methods
 of doing so (stream shift , compression etc).
 will have access to static class protocol - this will tell agent what to
 do and at which step
