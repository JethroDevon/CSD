	â€¢ in order to simulate a message passing from Alice to Bob or vice versa
	it might make sense to always pass to Charlie to pass on, this
	should simulate the messages transport over the public network, im
	not sure if I should make it clear that the message is being intercepted
	by charlie and that charlie isn't given the message as part of
	the protocol.
