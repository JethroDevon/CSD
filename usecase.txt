an explanation on classes functionality and basic functions within them


• GUI

 will need to contain a lot of swing components for managing options
 for the whole app however other classes will also contain some
 swing components so as to control logic and access to data, the Gui
 class will create all swing components in its constructor

 - send() and JButton 'send' this will take text from JTextField 'plaintext'
   	  and begin the first step of the selected crypto system, from here
	  on next step will demonstrate each step and sending another
	  plaintext message at any stage will reset the demo.

 - nextStep() JButton 'next_step' will play a single step of the selected
   	  cryptosystem and or cipher, each step will correlate with output
	  in the console output box

 - radio buttons.  Several option buttons will be available these
   	  will have an affect on how the protocol class goes through
	  which steps to demonstrate the cipher or crypto system

 - console output box. A JTextField 'console' will output data relating to
   	   each step of the algorithm

 - exit() will exit the program

• Agent

 class will have functions to display a window of text and an item of data
 on it that will relate to just one step of each stage of the selected
 methods protocol

 - addLogEntry() logs a

 - nextLog()

 - outputWindows()



• Protocol

Class is called protocol as it will have to manage each step of the protocols that
will make up a working cryptosystem, this class will also have options in the form
of radio buttons and logic based on what sub options to show
