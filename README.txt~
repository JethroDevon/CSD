					Demonstration of various types of encryption


This program will simulate encryption methods and demonstrate them working with a java swing gui
by showing two text input fields, one on the left and another the right these will show what Alice and Bob can see respectivley.

The box in the middle will show the public cipher text this is all that Charlie can see also and Gui.java will manage this.

Protocol.java will manage messages between other objects, some cryptographic systems requir one message to be passed back and fourth
a few times and so will be needed to be handled with a set protocol

Encryption.java will contain a few decrypting and encrypting functions including deliberatley bad examples or simplified examples.

Charlie.java may contain some functions to analyse some of the public cipher text, this will be implimented if theres time.
