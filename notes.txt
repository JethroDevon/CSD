			NOTES AND DIFFICULTIES WHILE CODING


	• Although it was necessary to use the BigInteger datatype in order
	to use the modPow() I later found I could have bought the modulus forward
	ie: Mᵉ mod n === java.Math( M, e % n) % n

	• Created an alternative constructor in Cryptography class, if the RSA
	algorithm isnt being used I can save time by not finding prime numbers
	which is expensive

	• In order to simulate a message passing from Alice to Bob or vice versa
	it might make sense to always pass to Charlie to pass on, this
	should simulate the messages transport over the public network, im
	not sure if I should make it clear that the message is being intercepted
	by charlie and that charlie isn't given the message as part of
	the protocol.

	• Changing the options button at any time will reset the whole program
	immediatley, this will save the protocol from being changed halfway
	through the running of the demo and creating unkown states.

	• Button groups in swing help avoid changing state while program
	is running - although this was eventualy overcome when I decided
	to do the whole system in one go and then use next step to go
	back over the even in parts.

	• changed the use for console log output box, this was going
	to show the steps and working for each encryption decryption as
	all the programs output data however it made more sense to list
	the output in the agent boxes and to use the explanations with
	the same numbers in the log to understand the steps in better
	detail.
